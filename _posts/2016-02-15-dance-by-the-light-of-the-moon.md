'Dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling

your ring?' Said the Piggy, 'I will.'

So they took it away, and were married next day

By the Turkey who lives on the hill.

They dined on mince, and slices of quince,

Which they ate with a runcible spoon;

And hand in hand, on the edge of the sane,

They danced by the light of the moon,

The moon, 

The moon,

They danced by the light of the moon.

~Edward Lear
